# Web FM synthesizer made with HTML5

## What is this?
This FM synthesizer is developed by [@takmiz](https://twitter.com/takmiz), and I have integrated two of the feature from Progressive Web Apps features such as offline, add to home screen.

So this FM synthesizer can run on your browser(even on you mobile) whenever you want regardless of the network connectivity.

Do not forget to use HTTPS URL when you use MIDI devices!
